##  How to Play

The objective is simple: **repeat the sequence of flashing colors generated by the computer**.

1.  **Start the Game:** Click anywhere on the screen or press the dedicated start button .
2.  **Watch the Sequence:** The game will flash one or more colors in a specific, randomized order. *Pay close attention!*
3.  **Repeat the Sequence:** Once the computer sequence is finished, you must click the colored buttons in the **exact same order**.
4.  **Advance:** If you repeat the sequence correctly, the game advances to the next level, and the sequence gets one color longer.
5.  **Game Over:** If you click the wrong color, the game ends, and your final score/level is displayed.
